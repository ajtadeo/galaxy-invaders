# Galaxy Invaders
This game is an improved recreation of my first big computer science project, **Galaxy Invaders**, a Galaga clone written in JavaScript and built using CodeHSGraphics on the CodeHS platform. The original code for the game is available in `archive.js`, and still works when pasted into a [CodeHS Sandbox](https://codehs.com/explore/sandbox). 

I decided to revisit this project as a senior in college to finish the game and implement features I couldn't do as a senior in high school. The game is playable at [https://ajtadeo.github.io/galaxy-invaders](https://ajtadeo.github.io/galaxy-invaders).
